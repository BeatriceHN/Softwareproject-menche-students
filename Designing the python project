# Desining the python project

1. Processing data
  - 2 main types of data files
      - 1st file: 2 columns containing [Protein 1, Protein 2] -> PPI
      - 2nd file: 3 columns containing [protein,	location,	source(s)]

  - How do we structure the data for the network?
    - eg. [protein 1, location 1, protein 2, location 2]
  - Certain proteins have multiple locations, how do we decide in which location the PPI takes place?
  - What groups or categories do we want to include for the network (location, connectivity etc.)?
  - The network is supposed to be multilayered. What information should be in each layer -> create data files for each layer with PPI

2. PPI Network:
  - What lay out will be used?
  - How will the edges be weighted?
  - What catergories will be used?
  - Test out each layer on a 2D Network
  - Combine the 2D networks and link them into 3D

3. 3D visualisation of cell:
  - Decide upon cell model (eukaryote)
  - Create a 3D model of cell
  - connect it to network
  - Should the model be interactive or the network or both?

4. Maybe VR?
